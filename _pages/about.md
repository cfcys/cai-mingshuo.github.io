I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Artifical Intelligence](https://sai.xidian.edu.cn/), [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, remote sensing image processing, and the interpretability of AI Security.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Bobo Xi](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/xibobo/) of [State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks](https://isn.xidian.edu.cn/), School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University.

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
